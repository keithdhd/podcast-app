To learn more, please go to WakingUp.com.  \n\nSam Harris received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA.",

We make daily decisions about how to spend money, time, energy, focus and attention – and ultimately, our life.\nHow do we make smarter decisions? How do we think from first principles?\nOn the surface, Afford Anything seems like a podcast about money and investing.\nBut under the hood, this is a show about how to think critically, recognize our behavioral blind spots, and make smarter choices. We’re into the psychology of money, and we love metacognition: thinking about how to think.\nIn some episodes, we interview world-class experts: professors, researchers, scientists, authors. In other episodes, we answer your questions, talking through decision-making frameworks and mental models.\nWant to learn more? Download our free book, Escape, at http://affordanything.com/escape.
